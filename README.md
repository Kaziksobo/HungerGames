<h1 align="center">Simulating the Hunger Games</h1>

---

<p align="center">My attempt at simulating the Hunger Games using Python. This includes creating a customisable arena, including its resources, and tributes. We can then use this to play Gamemaker and design the perfect Hunger Games for maximum entertainment.

## 🧐 About <a name = "about"></a>

Whilst I have never been much of a fan of the Hunger Games series bar watching the movies and reading the books once as a kid, the concept of the games themselves are morbidly interesting. I also believe that the games themselves are not designed that well in the books and movies, and that I could do a better job. 

Problem 1: The cornucopia. Concentrating all of the high value resources in the centre of the arena, and starting all the players in the same place gives the players two choices: fight for the best resources, in which case they are likely to die, or run away and try to survive with what little they can find in the rest of the arena, which can be quite boring to watch. Even minecraft hunger games servers figured that resources should be spread out lol.

Problem 2: Dying of natural causes. Whilst I understand the morbid entertainment the veiwers may get from watching the tributes fight and kill each other, watching them die of natural causes is not entertaining. So the players should be encouraged to come into contact with each other, increasing the likelihood of a fight.

Problem 3: Gamemaker intervention. In the series the gamemakers often intervene to force the tributes to come into contact with each other, however I believe that this would be unnecessary if the arena was designed well.

So far I have created a customsable arena with different elevations and terrains that can be displayed using matplotlib.
